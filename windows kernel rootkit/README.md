## SSDT windows kernel rootkit

This is an old school windows kernel mode rootkit. It hides process, files and registry keys. It can 
be used in conjunction with other malware to keep them stealthy.
Rootkit hooks the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), to replace some core functions and filter 
the results. Rootkit filters and hides Processes, Files and Registry keys.

### Note
This rootkit was successfully used under real attacks back in 2012.
